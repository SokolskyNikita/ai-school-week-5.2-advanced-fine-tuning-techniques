# Week 5.1: Advanced Fine-tuning Techniques

## Introduction

This project covers advanced fine-tuning techniques using HuggingFace, specifically focusing on PEFT, LoRA, and QLoRA methods to fine-tune open-source models.

## Usage

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Open Colab:**
   - Open a new Colab notebook by visiting [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Change Runtime:**
   - Go to `Runtime` > `Change runtime type`.
   - Set the runtime to `T4 GPU` from the dropdown. This is available on the free tier.

3. **Copy/Paste Code:**
   - Copy the code from the Jupyter notebook in the `in_class_examples` directory.
   - Paste the code into your Colab notebook.

4. **Run Code Blocks:**
   - Execute each code block sequentially to fine-tune the models using PEFT, LoRA, and QLoRA techniques.

5. **HuggingFace Personal Token:**
   - You will need your HuggingFace personal access token. If you don't have one, create an account on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) and generate a token from your account settings.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully fine-tune open-source models using HuggingFace.
